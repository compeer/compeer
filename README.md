# Magnet
Magnetize your project! Magnet is a tool for decentralized communities to attract talent, align interests in a magnetic field, and propagate value back to contributors.

## MVP
Currently I am prototyping an MVP that helps community leaders create, manage, and fund continuous vesting packages for contributors from a multisig wallet. Magnet will also make these vesting packages visible to members of the community to enhance transparency.

Your feedback and ideas are welcome.
